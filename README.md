## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains my complete **Operating Systems & Architecture** projects demonstrating practical **virtualization**, **network configuration**, and **computer architecture research**.

It showcases two major lab assignments:
1. **Operating System Virtualization & Computer Architecture Research (Part 1)**  
2. **Windows Server 2022 Virtualization Lab (Part 2)**  

Both projects were performed using **Oracle VirtualBox** and **Windows Server 2022**, simulating real-world IT infrastructure environments.

## ⚙️ Part 1 – Operating System Virtualization & Architecture Research

### 🧩 Practical Component
- Created two virtual machines in Oracle VirtualBox (DNS + Web Server).  
- Configured **DNS Server** for name resolution and **IIS Web Server** for hosting a one-page landing site (`digitech.abc`).  
- Assigned static IPs, tested connectivity, and verified the hosted site via domain name.  

### 🧠 Research Component
Explored and compared key computing architectures:
- The **evolution of computers** from vacuum tubes to microprocessors.  
- **Raspberry Pi** vs **Arduino** platform architectures.  
- Contributions of **Seymour Cray** and supercomputer designs.  
- Modern **Mainframe systems** and their enterprise applications.

## ⚙️ Part 2 – Windows Server 2022 Virtualization Lab

### 🧩 Network Configuration
- Deployed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** on DNS Server.  
- Configured **DHCP**, **DNS**, and **Group Policies** for centralized network management.  
- Implemented password, lockout, and logon-hour restrictions.  
- Created departmental folders with NTFS permissions.

### 💾 RAID & WSUS Setup
- Configured **RAID 1 (Drive F:)** and **RAID 5 (Drive E:)** for redundancy and performance.  
- Attempted **WSUS** installation for centralized patch management.

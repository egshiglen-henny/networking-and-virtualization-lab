## 🧠 Project Overview

This repository contains my **Networking & Virtualization** module projects demonstrating practical **system administration**, **virtualization**, and **network configuration** using **Windows Server 2022** and **Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)** on **Oracle VirtualBox**.

It combines both **Windows** and **Linux** virtualization environments to simulate real-world IT infrastructure, network services, and security management.

### 💡 Projects Included
1. **Operating System Virtualization & Computer Architecture Research (Part 1)**  
2. **Windows Server 2022 Virtualization Lab (Part 2)**  
3. **Linux Virtual Network — Proof of Concept (Part 3)**

## ⚙️ Part 1 – Operating System Virtualization & Architecture Research

### 🧩 Practical Component
- Created two virtual machines in Oracle VirtualBox (DNS + Web Server).  
- Configured **DNS Server** for name resolution and **IIS Web Server** for hosting a one-page landing site (`digitech.abc`).  
- Assigned static IPs, tested connectivity, and verified the hosted site via domain name.  

### 🧠 Research Component
Explored and compared key computing architectures:
- The **evolution of computers** from vacuum tubes to microprocessors.  
- **Raspberry Pi** vs **Arduino** platform architectures.  
- Contributions of **Seymour Cray** and supercomputer designs.  
- Modern **Mainframe systems** and their enterprise applications.

## ⚙️ Part 2 – Windows Server 2022 Virtualization Lab

### 🧩 Network Configuration
- Deployed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** on DNS Server.  
- Configured **DHCP**, **DNS**, and **Group Policies** for centralized management.  
- Implemented password, lockout, and logon-hour restrictions.  
- Created departmental folders with NTFS permissions.

### 💾 RAID & WSUS Setup
- Configured **RAID 1 (Drive F:)** and **RAID 5 (Drive E:)** for redundancy and performance.  
- Installed **WSUS** for centralized patch management.

## 🧩 Part 3 – Linux Virtual Network (Proof of Concept)

![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-Ubuntu%2024.04-orange)
![Tool](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tool-VirtualBox-blue)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-brightgreen)

This project demonstrates the creation of a **Linux-based virtual network infrastructure** using **Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble Numbat)** in **Oracle VirtualBox**, simulating client-server interaction, security configurations, and research-based activities.

### 🔧 Key Tasks
- Created and configured two VMs: `ubuntuserver` and `ubuntuclient`
- Installed **Apache Web Server** and **Lynx Browser** for web testing  
- Captured **ICMP** and **TCP/IP 3-way handshake** traffic using **Wireshark**  
- Enabled **SSH** connections and managed **UFW** & **iptables** firewall rules  
- Set up **Samba** for cross-platform file sharing between Linux and Windows  
- Compared **Linux vs Windows boot processes** and explored password recovery
